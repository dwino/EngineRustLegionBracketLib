Roguelike (and possibly other) engine using Rust - legion ecs - bracket-lib.

## Acknowledgment
This is my personal continuation of the roguelike game/engine you build in the book ['Hands on Rust'](https://hands-on-rust.com/) by Herbert Wolverson that uses his [Bracket-Lib](https://github.com/amethyst/bracket-lib) library. I picked it up to learn more about Rust in a fun way, but mainly because it builds a roguelike! I really recommend the book! I'm still learning a lot from it. I also checked out the code of his most recent 7DRL project [SecBot](https://thebracket.itch.io/secbot) and of the Rust version of his Game [NoxFutura](https://github.com/thebracket/noxfutura). If you are interested in building roguelikes (or other games) in Rust, you should really check out his work, [this](https://rustgamedev.com/episodes/interview-with-herbert-wolverson-bracket-lib) is a podcast where he talks about it.
