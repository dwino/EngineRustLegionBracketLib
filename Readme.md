# Rooted

## Descripion
A Roguelike (procedural generation, turn-based) which focussed on exploration and discovery of the living fable-like world of an underground ecosystem.

## Story
You are Root, a fraction of a tree's rootsystem.  This tree ('HomeTree') is dying due to a pollution of an unknown source and therefore imbued you with life in order for you to go deep underground and find a legendary spring that contains water with magical healing properties and bring back a drop of it to save HomeTree, and possibly find out about the source of the pollution.
